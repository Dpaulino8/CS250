How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Gather user feedback. This can be done through interviews, surveys, focus groups, or usability testing. Ask users about their pain points, what they like and dislike about existing solutions, and what they would like to see in a new product or feature.
Analyze the data. Once you have gathered feedback, identify the common themes and trends. What are the most important needs that users have? What are the most common pain points? What are the most popular features or functionality?
Prioritize the needs. Not all user needs are created equal. Some needs are more important than others, and some are more feasible to implement than others. Prioritize the needs based on their importance and feasibility.
Design the solution. Once you have prioritized the needs, you can start to design a solution. This involves breaking down the problem into smaller tasks, and designing each task in detail.
Implement the solution. This is where you write the code that implements the solution you designed.
Test the solution. Once you have implemented the solution, you need to test it to make sure it meets the user needs and works as intended.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Scrum: Scrum is a popular agile framework that uses a sprint-based approach.
